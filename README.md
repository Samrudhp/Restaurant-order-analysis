## Analysis Components

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- Loads order details and menu items from CSV files
- Merges datasets based on item IDs
- Performs initial data exploration

### 2. Popular Dishes Analysis
- Calculates and visualizes top 10 most ordered dishes
- Creates bar chart showing order frequencies

### 3. Sales Performance Analysis
- Calculates total sales amount per dish
- Visualizes top 10 dishes by revenue
